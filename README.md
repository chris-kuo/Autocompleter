# Autocompleter
Word completion from partial input implemented using trie and handles single input errors
The same class can also be used as spell check by supplying complete word input rather than partial input, however the suggestion criteria would need to be updated to include length matching as one of the weights.

A simple demo is provided with the source code to demonstrate suggestions from incremental partial matching.
